# Agent Registry examples

Runnable samples for the **Google Cloud Agent Registry** client (`google.golang.org/adk/v2/agentregistry`) — a governed catalog of A2A agents, MCP servers, and model endpoints. One sample browses the catalog; the other builds an agent out of what it finds.

Every example has its own README with a Mermaid diagram, a goal, run instructions, and an example session.

## Prerequisites

Both samples talk to the real `agentregistry.googleapis.com`. You need:

- a project with the Agent Registry API enabled,
- `roles/agentregistry.viewer` on it (reading is enough here — without it every call fails with `403 PERMISSION_DENIED`),
- Application Default Credentials.

```bash
gcloud services enable agentregistry.googleapis.com --project=your-project --billing-project=your-project
gcloud auth application-default login
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project
```

You probably don't have to register anything to try the samples: enabling a supported Google Cloud API auto-registers its **remote MCP server** in your registry. A fresh project typically already lists `run.googleapis.com`, `logging.googleapis.com`, `compute.googleapis.com`, and friends — all of which `bind` can consume as-is.

The client authenticates with ADC and bills the quota project (`GOOGLE_CLOUD_QUOTA_PROJECT`, then the credentials' `quota_project_id` on the ADC path, then `Config.ProjectID` — which these samples take from `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`). `gcloud` picks its quota project separately, so pass `--billing-project` to it or an unrelated default can deny the call with `USER_PROJECT_DENIED`.

To see what is registered without running any Go code:

```bash
gcloud agent-registry agents list      --location=global --project=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT --billing-project=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
gcloud agent-registry mcp-servers list --location=global --project=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT --billing-project=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
```

### If you get `403 PERMISSION_DENIED`

Check which project you are actually hitting — `echo $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`. A shell profile or a previous `gcloud config set` often leaves a default pointing at a project without the API enabled or without the viewer role, and the resource in the error names the project the call actually went to:

```text
Failed to list agents: HTTP 403 — PERMISSION_DENIED: Permission 'agentregistry.agents.list'
denied on resource '//agentregistry.googleapis.com/projects/some-other-project/locations/global'
Grant roles/agentregistry.viewer on this project, or point GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT at one where you have it.
```

The message names the exact permission and resource; either grant it or set `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` for the run. Both samples condense the API's error envelope like this by unwrapping `*agentregistry.APIError` — see `explain` in either `main.go`.

## Examples

| Example | What it demonstrates | LLM? |
|---|---|---|
| [`discover`](./discover) | Browse the catalog: `AllAgents` / `AllMCPServers` / `AllEndpoints` with a server-side filter and automatic paging | No |
| [`bind`](./bind) | Bind an agent to a *capability*: find the MCP server that declares the tool you need, then `MCPToolset` it | Yes |

Start with `discover` to see what your project has; `bind` then needs no resource names at all.

## How the pieces fit

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Registry["agentregistry.googleapis.com"]
        A[agents]
        M[mcpServers]
        E[endpoints]
    end
    C["agentregistry.Client"]
    A --> C
    M --> C
    E --> C
    C -- "RemoteAgent(name)" --> RA["agent.Agent<br/>(A2A sub-agent)"]
    C -- "MCPToolset(name)" --> TS["tool.Toolset<br/>(MCP over HTTP)"]
    RA --> App["Your LlmAgent"]
    TS --> App
    App -. "A2A / MCP, direct" .-> Remote[(Remote agent / MCP server)]
```

The dotted line is the point of the whole thing: **the registry is a catalog, never a proxy.** It hands you a card and a URL; the traffic then goes straight from your process to the remote endpoint.

## Registering your own agent

The registry's write surface is the `Service` resource. You create a `Service`; the registry *projects* read-only `Agent` and `McpServer` resources from it — those are what the client reads, and they carry generated IDs like `agentregistry-00000000-0000-0000-630f-070a9d06e171`, not the ID you chose. Get the projected name from `services describe`:

```bash
gcloud agent-registry services create my-agent \
  --location=global --project=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT --billing-project=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT \
  --display-name="My Agent" \
  --agent-spec-type=a2a-agent-card \
  --agent-spec-content="$(cat agent-card.json)"

gcloud agent-registry services describe my-agent \
  --location=global --project=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT --billing-project=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT \
  --format='value(registryResource)'
```

Three traps worth knowing before you spend an afternoon on them:

- **Use `--agent-spec-type=a2a-agent-card`, not `no-spec`.** `a2a-agent-card` embeds the card `RemoteAgent` reads. `no-spec` leaves the record with neither a card nor an `A2A_AGENT` protocol, so resolution falls through to the protocol lookup and fails with `A2A connection URI not found`.
- **The card's `skills` must be non-empty**, each with `id`/`name`/`description`/`tags`, or the create call is rejected.
- **The card's `protocolBinding` must match how your server actually serves** — `HTTP+JSON` for `a2asrv.NewRESTHandler`, `JSONRPC` for `a2asrv.NewJSONRPCHandler`. A mismatch only shows up as an empty reply at the first message. (The registry stores the binding as `HTTP_JSON`; the client maps that to A2A's `HTTP+JSON`. Both spellings are correct in their own domain.)

## Core concepts at a glance

- **Client** — `agentregistry.New(ctx, Config{ProjectID, Location})`; pass `Config.HTTPClient` to supply your own (pre-authenticated) transport instead of ADC.
- **Discovery** — each collection has three methods: `List*` (one page), `Get*` (one resource by full name), and `All*` (an `iter.Seq2` that pages on demand and yields a single `(nil, err)` if a page fetch fails).
- **List options** — `WithFilter`, `WithPageSize`, `WithPageToken`; `All*` manages the page token itself.
- **Factory helpers** — `Client.RemoteAgent` resolves an agent record (embedded A2A card, else synthesized from its protocols) into an `agent.Agent`; `Client.MCPToolset` resolves an MCP server record into a `tool.Toolset`.
- **Egress auth is separate from registry auth.** `MCPToolset` reuses the registry's ADC client for `*.googleapis.com` endpoints; `RemoteAgent` never authenticates for you — pass `WithA2AHTTPClient` / `WithA2AHeaders` (or `WithMCPHTTPClient` / `WithMCPHeaders`) for anything else.
- **Errors** — a non-2xx response comes back as `*agentregistry.APIError` with `StatusCode` and `Body`.
