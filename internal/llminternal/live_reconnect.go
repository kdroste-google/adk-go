// every frame comes back, which is initialBackoff, because content restarts the

//
// Two counters bound the loop, because either alone leaves a hole:
//
//   - maxAttempts bounds consecutive reconnects and drives the backoff. It
//     resets whenever a connection works — the model delivers content, or the
//     connection outlives healthyUptime — so a call that rides out an
//     occasional dropped connection is never killed for it. On its own it never
//     fires against a backend that serves one frame per connection and then
//     hangs up, because that backend keeps resetting it.
//   - maxTotal bounds reconnects across the whole invocation and resets
//     nowhere. Only a connection that died inside healthyUptime counts towards
//     it, so the routine cycling the Live API does to a long session is free
//     while a backend that flaps is not.
//
// What this does not bound is a backend that serves for longer than
// healthyUptime and then drops, over and over. That is indistinguishable from a
// healthy session the server keeps cycling, so it is left to run; healthyUptime
// is at the same time the floor on how often such a loop can dial. A caller slow
// enough to stretch every connection past healthyUptime buys the same
// treatment, which is safe for the failure this bounds: the loop can only run
// as fast as the caller consumes it, so it cannot become a redial storm.
